# usage-band

A Claude Code mod that puts a one-line band above the prompt with what you need to keep an eye on while you work:

- **5h / 7d** — how much of your 5-hour and 7-day rate-limit windows is used, and when each resets
- **Context** — tokens in the context window out of its size
- **Cache hit** — how much of the last turn's input the prompt cache served

Each metric has its own color and turns red when it needs attention: by default a limit or the context past 80%, or a cache hit rate under 50% (both configurable, see Settings). The limit bars carry a slow shine that sweeps left to right, in step across bars.

## How it looks

**Terminal**

```
5h ■■■■■■■■ 78% · 1h18m  7d ■■■■■■■■ 48% · 5d3h  󰌨 398K/1M  󰓾 100%
```

The line fits itself to the terminal width: on a narrow terminal it drops the bars first, then the countdowns.

**Desktop app (Code tab)**

A row of SVG groups that spreads across the full width of the band and wraps onto a second line when the window is narrow: limit bars that stretch with the window, with the figure and reset time beside them, the context window as a two-row dot matrix that gains columns as the window widens (2×10 at the narrowest, each dot 5% of the window), and the cache hit rate. Hairlines separate the groups. It follows the app's light and dark mode.

## Install

```
/plugin marketplace add SorcererAres/CC-Usage-Band
/plugin install usage-band@cc-usage-band
```

Then open a new session (or run `/reload-plugins`). Nothing to configure. Best in [Ghostty](https://ghostty.org), which ships the icon font.

## Settings

Terminal icons are picked automatically: Nerd Font icons in Ghostty, plain Unicode elsewhere. To override, set `USAGE_BAND_ICONS` in your shell profile to `auto`, `nerd`, `unicode` or `ascii`, e.g. `export USAGE_BAND_ICONS=unicode`.

The warning thresholds and the colors are plugin options, set in `/config`: `limitWarn` (default 80), `contextWarn` (80), `cacheWarn` (50), and `colorFiveHour`, `colorSevenDay`, `colorContext`, `colorCache`, `colorWarn` as `#rrggbb` hex colors. An invalid value falls back to its default.

Run `/usage-band-preview` to see the band in every terminal style side by side, including how a 256-color terminal shows the colors.

## Notes

- The 5h / 7d figures come from your subscription's rate-limit headers, so they appear after the first response of a session and only on a subscription.
- The cache hit rate is the last turn's cache reads over all its input (uncached + cache reads + cache writes), summed over the turn's requests.
- The desktop text uses Inter when it is installed and falls back to SF Pro / the system UI font.

## What it can reach

Mods run with the same access as Claude Code itself; they are not sandboxed. This one only:

- reads the session's usage figures (`$.session.usage`, `session.measure`, `turn.complete`)
- reads the `TERM_PROGRAM` and `USAGE_BAND_ICONS` environment variables to pick terminal icons, and its own plugin options for thresholds and colors
- registers the `/usage-band-preview` command and draws the band

It reads no files, runs no processes and makes no network requests.
